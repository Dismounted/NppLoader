NppLoader
====

NppLoader assists in the replacement of the default Windows Notepad with Notepad++. It does this via a trick within a debugging tool, called "Image File Execution Options". It means that anytime Notepad is to be run, Notepad++ is run instead.

Installation
----

1. Compile NppLoader.exe (or use the already compiled executable).
2. Move the loader into Notepad++'s installation directory.
3. Check the path to the loader in the registry file.
3. Apply the appropriate registry file.
4. Enjoy Notepad++!
